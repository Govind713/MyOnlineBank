This webpage leverages JavaScript and localStorage to simulate basic banking operations. Users can perform essential functions such as depositing and withdrawing funds. Additionally, the application supports account creation by allowing users to register with a unique username, account number, and password. Once registered, users can log in using their saved credentials, securely stored in localStorage. This implementation provides a simple yet effective approach to managing banking transactions and user authentication in a web environment.
